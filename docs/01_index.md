# User Guide

## Introduction
Welcome to the Reflexia!! This guide will help you navigate through the app and utilize its features effectively.
The Reflexia app allows users to create model-based reflex agents as bots. These bots start in an initial state, and when a user interacts with them, the bot's current state is updated based on the defined model. The bot then transitions from one state to another, ultimately returning to the initial state. This model-based approach enables the bots to exhibit reflex-like behaviors that respond dynamically to user interactions.

## Why Reflexia

The Reflexia app empowers users to create intelligent, model-based reflex agents as bots. The model-based approach used in Reflexia offers several key benefits:

1. **Adaptability**: Model-based agents can dynamically adapt their behavior based on the current state and user interactions, allowing for more natural and responsive interactions.

2. **Flexibility**: The modular nature of the model-based approach enables users to easily modify and update the bot's behavior to suit their needs.

3. **Transparency**: By defining the bot's behavior through an explicit model, users can better understand and trust the agent's decision-making process.

4. **Scalability**: The model-based architecture of Reflexia bots allows for the creation of complex, multi-faceted agents that can handle a wide range of user interactions and tasks.

By leveraging the power of model-based reflex agents, the Reflexia app enables users to build intelligent, adaptable, and transparent bots that can enhance their overall user experience.

## Dashboard
The Dashboard is your home base. Here, you can find:
- **User Information**: Overview of your current plan, Chips, Storage space, and interactions.
- **Payment Feature**: Manage your subscription and payment details.
- **Chips**: Chips refer to the individual components or building blocks that users can use to create their bot models within the Reflexia app.
- **Interactions**:  Interactions represent the various user activities and engagements within the Reflexia app including the number of actions performed.

## Intelligence
In this section, you can define the intelligence for your bots:
- **Folders**: Organize your chips into folders.
- **Chip Groups**: Chip Groups are collections of related Chips that users can define to organize and manage the intelligence of their bots more effectively.

## Terminals
Terminals are where you create your bots:
- **Terminals**: Terminals are the interfaces within the Reflexia app where users can create and manage their Telegram bots. Users can attach one or more Chip Groups to these Terminals to define the intelligence and behavior of their bots.

## General Attributes
This section allows you to define key-value variables:
- **Variables**: Accessible across all your bots for consistent behavior and data management.

## Profile Management
